7 Network Engineer Interview Questions and Answers
Whether you are preparing to interview a candidate or applying for a job, 
review our list of top Network Engineer interview questions and answers.


1. What resources do you use to stay on top of innovations in the industry?

The technology industry is fast-paced, and new network solutions could significantly 
improve your infrastructure. The network engineer should have the initiative to 
continually learn about the latest and greatest technology. You're not looking for 
any particular resource in the applicant's answer, simply that they do stay on top 
of things. What to look for:

Dedication to learning
Reasons for choosing the resources
Ability to stay on top of trends

Example: "I participate in a local network engineer Meetup group, read Network World and 
use an RSS reader to consolidate several news sources that frequently cover network innovations. "


2. Have you coordinated with development teams and other stakeholders while deploying network resources?

Cross-collaboration between teams and departments is a common trend in the business world. 
The available network resources can significantly impact an organization's software development 
and other projects. The applicant should provide an answer that makes you feel confident in 
their ability to communicate and work with multiple people. What to look for:

Strong communication skills
Ability to coordinate
Experience working with other teams

Example: "I have five years of experience working in a DevOps team. I worked hand in hand with 
the developers to ensure that they have access to a network that supported what their 
applications needed to perform.


3. What safeguards do you put in a network design to limit data loss?

Data loss can cause systems to stop and productivity to grind to a halt. This risk is a 
common one that the network engineer should be prepared for. Look for an answer that goes 
into detail on the type of safeguards they use and why they have selected them. What to look for:

Selection process
Understanding of data loss risk
Experience with this situation
Example: "I build disaster recovery resources into the network plan and focus on high availability. 
Company data is safeguarded in several ways, such as regularly scheduled backups and distributed 
network storage locations."


4. Can you draw a network topography you worked on before and explain the design to me?

One of the primary duties of a network engineer is creating the network blueprints for your 
organization. The applicant should be able to quickly sketch out a diagram and explain their 
decision-making process behind that topography. What to look for:

Well-illustrated design
Easy to understand explanation
Solid network design
Example: "This network topography is what I implemented at a mid-size financial organization. 
I needed to keep security and availability at the forefront of the design, which is why I 
used this particular configuration to serve their needs."


5. What is the largest size network you have engineered?

This question allows you to gauge whether the applicant has hands-on experience with networks 
sized similarly to yours. They don't necessarily have to be in the same industry or use 
identical technology to your organization. You're looking for a general familiarity with 
the challenges and requirements that come with a company of your size. What to look for:

Lots of details
Similar sized network
Hands-on experience
Example: "I created and implemented networks for small business clients that ranged from a 
two-person operation to 200 people. These networks supported single locations and used a mix 
of on-premises solutions and cloud-based applications."


6. Can you walk me through your troubleshooting process when you aren't getting the expected 
performance out of your network configuration?

This question gives you a first-hand look at the way the applicant approaches a complex problem. 
There are countless ways to approach this issue, and it's valuable to see how the applicant goes 
about it. What to look for:

Analytical thinking
Solid process
Willingness to ask for help
Example: "The first thing I do is eliminate any low-hanging fruit. I'll check for network outages, 
hardware failures, high network activity and other common causes of poor performance. Once I've 
ruled those out, I'll use network monitoring and analytics tools to get more information about 
the cause of the problem. I'll also reach out to network administrators and technicians to speed 
up the process if I run into problems."


7. How have you scaled networks to accommodate an organization's changing needs?

It's expensive to recruit talented network engineers, so you want someone who is suitable for 
the long term. As your organization grows and adapts to changes in the business world, 
your network should be capable of keeping up with new needs. Look for an answer that 
displays familiarity with various scaling methods. What to look for:

Understanding of scaling methods
Experience with network scaling
Willingness to learn new scaling methods
Example: "I worked with a startup company selling a product that went from 0 to 15,000 
users in the first year. I started with a small-scale on-premises network capable of 
supporting the basic operations of the company to get them started. As we onboarded users, 
I integrated our on-premises resources with ACME Web Services so we could handle traffic 
spikes from successful marketing campaigns."


8. How many bits do you need for a subnet size.
	The minimum addresses needed is 2 bits for 4 addresses 2^(# of addresses) = 2^2 which used 
	for point to point links. Max addresses can go as much as class A IP address /8 so for maximum 
	bits is 32-8 = 24 bit

9. Describe the process of making a TCP connection from a browser to a server through routers, switches, and a load balancer
	Client Browser -> lookup local hostfile -> Local DNS -> query IPS DNS using PC to Gateway (ISP)-> 
	ISP DSN Answer Remote Server IP -> Server's ISP Router -> Server's Firewall -> LB ->
	3way Handshack to remote Server IP address -> Connection established

# Terminology
#################################################
3-way handshake (SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK)
	The 3 way handshake is a feature of TCP, which provides a service consisting of a serial two-way 
	data stream on top of the packet-oriented IP protocol. ... UDP does not implement 3 way handshake. 
	TCP does it to establish a session between the 2 peers.
	--------------------------------------------------
	Host A	<----> Host B
	--------------------------------------------------
	Host A sends a TCP SYNchronize packet to Host B
	Host B receives A's SYN request
	Host B sends a SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement
	Host A receives B's SYN-ACK
	Host A sends ACKnowledge
	Host B receives ACK. 
	TCP socket connection is ESTABLISHED.

Spanning-Tree Protocol	<- Protocol used in L2 networks to prevent broadcast storms that helps ensure 
							a loop free topology when multiple links are present between switches.
OSPF 	<- is link-state and distance-vector : link-state for intra-area computations and 
			distance-vector for inter-area/external route computations. For external area 
			route choosing, OSPF asks the ABR/ASBR on what is their view to the destination , 
			taking for granted what the router reports in.
		<- Open Shortest Path First. It is a protocol that allows routers to set routes between them. 
			As links go up and down, OSPF allows the routers to change routes so that the route taken 
			always is the shortest possible.

802.1af <- is an amendment to IEEE std 802.1X to establish security associations for 802.1ae MAC 
			Security, and provide media access method independent association discovery. It will 
			facilitate secure communication over publicly accessible LAN/MAN media for which security 
			has not otherwise been defined.


Wireshark	<- packet capture and review


ICMP 	<=  (Internet Control Message Protocol)is actually at the "top" of the layer 3. It uses the 
			IP protocol to deliver data to a remote host. In other words, ICMP messages must be 
			encapsulated in IP packets.
			
			

BGP 	<=(Border Gateway Protocol) is protocol that manages how packets are routed across the internet 
			through the exchange of routing and reachability information between edge routers. 
		BGP offers network stability that guarantees routers can quickly adapt to send packets 
		through another reconnection if one internet path goes down. 

RFC 	<- Remote Function Call
IETF 	<- Internet Engineering Task Force

STP		<- Spanning-Tree is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for 
			Ethernet networks. 
		  The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation 
		  that results from them.

UDP 	<- User Datagram Protocol 
TCP/IP	<- transmission control protocol/Internet protocol

Wi-Fi 1 would have been 802.11b, released in 1999.
Wi-Fi 2 would have been 802.11a, also released in 1999.
Wi-Fi 3 would have been 802.11g, released in 2003.
Wi-Fi 4 is 802.11n, released in 2009.
Wi-Fi 5 is 802.11ac, released in 2014.
Wi-Fi 6	<- 802.11ax

mtr		<- it investigates the network connection between the host mtr runs  on
       and  HOSTNAME.   by  sending  packets with purposely low TTLs. It continues to send
       packets with low TTL, noting the response time of the  intervening  routers.   This
       allows  mtr  to  print  the  response percentage and response times of the internet
       route to HOSTNAME.  A sudden increase in packet loss or response time is  often  an
       indication of a bad (or simply overloaded) link.

       The  results  are  usually reported as round-trip-response times in miliseconds and
       the percentage of packetloss.
